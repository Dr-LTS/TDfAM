# TDfAM
Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing

This repository contains the in-silico proof in principle Matlab code to support Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing (TDfAM).
The development of the code has been published in The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-019-04835-3 or in PDF format within this repository. 

Matlab and the associated licence is required to run the programme. 

The programme demonstrates in-silico, the TDfAM principle. It was developed to be compitable with Repetier Host
https://www.repetier.com/
and the dimensions of the Makerbot Replicator 2X. However, the code has not been tested or validated experimentally.

The principle investigator of this research, is currently on maternity leave. Therefore there will be a delay in uploading the software and licence.
