# TDfAM
Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing

This repository contains the in-silico proof in principle Matlab code to support Temporal Design for Additive Manufacturing (TDfAM).
The development of the code has been published in The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-019-04835-3 or in PDF format within this repository. 

Matlab and the associated license is required to run the programme. The software is licensed through an MIT license. 

The programme demonstrates in-silico, the TDfAM principle on a cuboid. It was developed to be compitable with Repetier Host
https://www.repetier.com/
and the dimensions of the Makerbot Replicator 2X. However, the code has not been tested or validated experimentally on this platform or any 3D printing equipment. The code simply outputs a computational demonstration of the technique. Please note the following text in the license file:
